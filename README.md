# Kodeloftet_Dag9

In today's lesson, we went through how to plan a website before we start coding. Good planning helps us start with a clear vision and clear goals for what we want to create. It also provides insight into how the HTML structure should be set up, and which CSS properties are needed to get the desired result.

An effective way to start is to create a list of required elements and locations, or use a tool like Figma to create a simple wireframe. A wireframe provides a visual overview of the structure we want, and can be easier to understand than a text-based list.
Once the content is planned, we can use CSS Flexbox for flexible placement of the elements. Flex makes it easy to achieve a layout that adapts to different screen sizes ‚Äì we can, for example, use flex-direction row for desktop and flex-direction column for mobile, to achieve a responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile.

When the plan is in place, either as a list or wireframe in Figma, we have a solid foundation to start coding. Feel free to start with a simple version using semantic HTML and CSS selectors with Flex to get a quick illustration of the website's layout and functionality. This helps us focus on the structure without being distracted by theme or design details.

By planning the structure before we decide on a theme, it becomes easier to get started and get a clear direction for the project.
On Wednesday, you will be tasked with planning and coding a website based on this planning process. If you start brainstorming ideas and making a simple plan already today, you can spend more time on coding when the task comes. The idea is that you should be well prepared, with a clear plan in place, before Wednesday's task starts.

This preparatory work gives you a head start, so that you can focus fully on coding the result directly from the planning and make the most of the time after the assignment is issued. Good luck with your preparations!
